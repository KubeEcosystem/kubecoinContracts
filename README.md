# Kube Ecosystem

## KubeWallet

KubeWallet is a sophisticated wallet designed to streamline interactions within the Kube ecosystem. It connects users to both the Cardano and EVM blockchains, enabling easy management of assets across these diverse blockchain environments. KubeWallet integrates all Kube-related services, providing a unified platform for transactions, asset management, and engagement with blockchain-specific applications.

### Key Features

* Multi-Blockchain Support: Connects users to both Cardano and EVM blockchains.
* Integrated Platform: Incorporates all Kube-related services including transactions, asset management, and application interaction within a single, unified platform.
* User-Friendly Interface: Designed to offer a simple and fast user experience.

### Technical Components

* Smart Contract Management: Utilizes smart contracts for managing transactions across different blockchains.
* API Integration: Directly interfaces with APIs of bridges like KubeCoin Bridge and decentralized platforms like KubeCross.
* Security Features: Incorporates advanced security protocols including multisig wallets and secure contract calls.

## KubeBridge

KubeBridge is a crucial connector between the Cardano and Avalanche blockchains. It employs a lock-and-unlock mechanism to facilitate the transfer of assets across blockchains without actually moving the underlying tokens. This ensures security during the transfer and maintains the integrity and continuity of the asset's value between different blockchain environments.

### Key Features

* 1-1 Token Swapping: Users can swap KUBE tokens at a 1:1 ratio between Avalanche (using EVM) and Cardano.
* User Interface: The bridge is accessible via a user-friendly interface.

### Technical Components

* Smart Contracts: Uses Solidity-based and Plutus-based smart contracts on the Avalanche and Cardano sides, respectively.
* Oracles: Built an oracle to ensure the synchronization of token states between the two distinct blockchains.

## KubeCross

KubeCross is a front-end application that enhances the security and efficiency of cross-chain and on-chain swaps. It operates by routing swaps through existing bridges and DEXs, directly interfacing with their APIs. This approach ensures that KubeCross can offer the best possible swap deals while maintaining high security standards.

### Key Features

* Direct API Integration: Routes swaps through established bridges and DEXs.
* Robust Architecture: Capable of rerouting operations in case of issues with a bridge or DEX.
* Enhanced Security: Uses fortified smart contract management and multisig wallets.

### Technical Components

* Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs): Locks transactions with unique cryptographic hashes and time-based locks.
* Atomicity: The transactions are atomic, either completing fully as per the agreement or being entirely invalidated.
* Smart-Order-Routing Engine: Optimizes the liquidity utilization from both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and DEXs.
